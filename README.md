***Data-Driven Business Performance Improvement at Apollo Pharmacy***


This project applies data-driven analysis to address the financial and operational challenges faced by a medium-sized Apollo Pharmacy branch in Panchmukhi, Patna. The primary objectives are to optimize discount strategies, improve inventory management, and strengthen competitiveness against rival pharmacies.



**Project Overview**


* Conducted a comprehensive analysis of 3 months of transactional data (sales, inventory, competitor data) across ~20 products in 5 major categories.
* Employed descriptive statistics, trend analysis, and comparative benchmarking to assess the relationship between discounts, sales, and revenue.
* Analysed inventory stock levels and stockouts to identify inefficiencies and recommend optimized restocking strategies.
* Compared Apollo’s performance with nearby competitors to highlight areas where Apollo is losing ground due to lower discounts and weaker inventory management.



**Data Collection**


Three types of datasets were collected:

1. Sales Data: Daily transactional data including product name, quantity sold, MRP, and discounts.
2. Inventory Data: Product-level opening stock, quantity received, and quantity sold, used to calculate closing stock and stockout trends.
3. Competitor Data: Two weeks of comparable data from nearby competitors, including sales, discount percentages, and revenue.



**Analysis Methods**


The following analytical methods were employed:

* Revenue \& Sales Analysis: Measured daily revenue and sales trends, and studied discount vs. sales relationships.
* Competitor Benchmarking: Compared Apollo’s category-wise sales and discount levels with competitors to evaluate performance gaps.
* Inventory Analysis: Identified products frequently going out of stock and assessed demand vs. stock trends.
* Profitability Analysis: Compared purchase prices vs. selling prices to determine product-level profit margins.
* Advanced Analysis: Category and product-level “Sales vs. Discount” sensitivity analysis.



**Results and Recommendations**


The analysis provided several actionable insights, including:


* Discount Optimization:

* Increase discounts in key categories such as Cold \& Flu and Vitamins \& Supplements where competitors outperform Apollo.
* Implement product-specific discounts for low-selling items.
* Align category-level discounts with competitors while maintaining profit margins.


* Inventory Management Enhancements:

* Restock high-demand items (e.g., Fish Oil, Multivitamin, Vitamin C) earlier and in larger quantities.
* Use demand forecasting to avoid stockouts during peak demand.
* Balance inventory to prevent overstocking during low sales periods.


* Competitive Positioning:

* Introduce targeted marketing campaigns and loyalty programs.
* Adopt CRM systems to record customer preferences and purchase history.
* Explore technology adoption for online sales and smarter inventory control.
